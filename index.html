      <h4 class = "">DISCOVER the life changing framework where you control your schedule and you determine the grades that you want and live your ideal lifesty</h4>
    <br>
      <p> Imagine setting your own schedule and attaining better grades studying less while enjoying yourself than you’re attaining in a whole week’s worth of mudding through what feels like an endless chore of work...</p>

      <p>imagine sustaining and improving your stellar exceptional academic grades, adding a side-hobby partying, hanging out with friends, or wakeboarding on the weekends if you choose to...</p>

      <p>
      If you'll stick with me for a few more minutes, I'll share the incredible insights I've learned about attaining and improving the academic success in your life, all while having fun and getting more freedom to do what you truly love.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 class = "center"><b>Before that, a few questions for you:</b></h3><br>

      <ul class = "browser-default">
        <li class = "browser-default"><b>Have you reached a point where you've ready to go beyond just having occasional, good grades and you want to discover and enjoy true consistent success</b>—a strategy which will be there for you to use even in the hard times, supporting your life goals, and making you stronger and better in every way?</li>
        <br>
        <li class = "browser-default"><b>Do you see yourself as already intelligent, but which you are interested in becoming much smarter  and more fulfilled</b> —a person who is competent, continually growing, and having fun... who has high self-esteem...who appreciates his/her successes... and who is really up to making the most of her life?</li>
        <br>
        <li class = "browser-default"><b>Is there a part of you that is actually ambitious enough to believe that having success while having fun is possible</b>, and that there is a whole lot of time you can free up for you to do what you want? Or maybe, have you found success academically already, and now you want to know how to progress to the next level and make sure the results is consistent, meaningful and satisfying?</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <br>

      <h5 class = "center"><i>Well, I’ll show you exactly how to achieve that.</i></h5>
      <br>
      <br>

      <h3>Now before I get into that....let me tell you a short story.... </h3>
        <br>
      <p>It’s about me but it just may be about YOU too...</p>
      <p>While I’ve gotten multiple scholarships and admission offers from some of the world’s best universities and have the freedom to travel across the globe as part of my job as a video strategist (my freelance business)...</p>
      <p>If you think I was gifted this way, let me tell you what <b><u>really happened.</b></u></p>

      <p>You see, over 4 years ago, I was a social, academic, and emotional wreck.</p>

      <p>I was a Junior College student, and I just shut myself off from the world in my lonely room playing computer games everyday while other students were busy eating out or partying after school.</p>
      <p>Even if I could get to their meeting, I didn’t have a clue what to say or do to fit in...<br>So after I’d just slink back to my little corner of the group...</p>

      <p><b>And feel sorry for my pathetic social life.</b></p>

      <p>I was an average Cs and Ds student, with the occasional A mark, I was also the lowest scorer of my English Literature cohort at other times.</p>
      <p> I had worked up the courage to attend meetups and even engage in the latest gossip news or chased girls who didn’t reciprocate my affection.</p>
      <p>After many months of trying very hard at mastering the subject just like I did in my rigorous academic studies, I was still stuck in academic and social hell…</p>
        <br>
      <h3>I thought, how hard could it be, and how long could it take?</h3>
        <br>
      <p>It turned out to be a lot of work…and I managed to fit in with my friends…and achieved straight As for my A levels!</p>
      <p>I became almost delusionally high on my academic successes and felt I was on top of the world!</p>
      <p>I applied to all the <b>top university courses</b> that I could find on the internet.</p>
      <p> And I decided to try for <b>every scholarship</b> that could use such a talent like me (looking back now rather embarrassingly).</p>

      <p>I started reading up <b>columns in the Cambridge law journals…</b> and watched <b>Youtube lectures of numerous law professors</b> and purchased all the <b>recommended books</b> for <b>admitted students</b> before I even submitted my application.</p>
      <p><b>It was like an egotist’s fantasy come true.</b></p>
      <p>So, I attended the interviews full of confidence....</p>
      <p>Until a year later while I was in the military..</p>

      <h3>I found out that all my applications to university courses I wanted were rejected… that my schoolmates were spreading nasty rumours about me behind my back… and my “military buddies” were ostracizing and sabotaging my equipment. </h3>
      <h3>And my world came crashing down.</h3>

      <p>When my parents asked how I fared for my university results...I lied that I hadn’t received it yet...and it made me miserable.</p>
      <p>I couldn’t face my parents as a disappointment and a failure... despite having worked so hard but still slip up....</p>
      <p>In a matter of weeks, I was standing at the end of my bunk corridor in the military camp staring at the rooftop access ledge, looking down during the wee hours of the morning...<b>trying to work up the courage to end the pain once and for all...</b></p>
      <p>I was rotting away inside.</p>
      <p>I burst out sobbing and dialed a final call to my parents...it was so embarrassing but I just could not keep it inside anymore. Thankfully, they rescued me off the edge and encouraged me to call the counselling hotline which supported me through my depressive phase. </p>

      <h2 class = "center">You see, I had fallen into the “extrinsic self-worth” trap...</h2>
      <p class = "nocenter">I thought that if...</p><i>
      <ul class = "nocenter browser-default">
        <li>I had just gotten better grades...</li>
        <li>Made my parents proud...</li>
        <li>Just gotten along with people well</li>
      </i>
      </ul>

      <p>... I would have succeeded as a human being and had value living.</p>

      <p>Essentially, because I had used my grades, success academically, socially and my family’s opinions of me to <b>make me feel good about myself...</b></p>
      <p>I constantly monitored my progress with these external "results" that I’d gotten...</p>
      <p>But I had forgotten <b>WHY</b> I was doing so.... I had lost the intrinsic enjoyment and fun of doing well...and the meaning of chasing those things...</p>
      <p>Basically...this is how most people think about grades and chase the results they want:</p>

      <h2 class = "center">By trying to “get” the end goal.</h2>
      <p>It made me reflect deeply on myself and what it means to succeed. </p>
      <p>Promise me you will never chase after the end results anymore</p>

      <h2 class = "center">Stop Chasing External Validation!</h2>

      <p>Trying to "get" the end goal for the sake of it never works for at least two reasons (and there’re more but let’s start with 2 for now).</p>

      <ol class = "browser-default">
        <li><b>When you only care about the end goal, you stop true learning and lose the intrinsic drive and motivation that it takes to achieve true excellence.</b> And you end up with inconsistent or subpar results and emptiness even when you succeed.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Any worthy goal worth attaining at all is bound to be filled with challenges – when you’re results-oriented – you’ll unlikely be <b>resilient enough to overcome these challenges and attain CONSISTENT excellent results.</b></li>
      </ol>

      <h1 class = "center">You can only truly effortlessly, enjoyably and consistently get the results that you dream of, and have the satisfaction and meaning that it brings...</h1>

      <ol class = "nocenter browser-default">
        <li>When you <b>lose yourself</b> in the process of learning rather than trying to "get" the end goal....</li>
        <br>
        <li>When you become <b>un-self-conscious</b> about interacting with other people and <b>stop caring about yourself so much</b>...and start to share and deploy true empathy with others and connect on a deeper level...</li>
        <br>
        <li>When you can relax and simply enjoy the process in the <b>state of FLOW</b> and attain <b>effortless excellence</b>..</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
     <h2 class = "center" style="color:blue;">Why then, do so many people still get drawn into results-oriented thinking in order to achieve?</h2>
      <h2 class = "center" style="color:blue;">Simple:</h2>
      <h2 class = "center" style="color:blue;">Because of <u>Fear</u>.</h2>

      <br>
      <p>Fear that you won’t be able to get the end result that you want or desperately need….</p>

      <p>Fear that you won’t be able to receive anything in return…</p>

      <p>Fear of making mistakes… and so you don’t truly learn…</p>

      <p>Fear that your pride and ego will be damaged or ruined – your reputation will be tarnished and you will look bad in front of others for messing up…</p>

      <p>Fear that you’ve just wasted your time on an endeavor that doesn’t give you the results that you want…</p>

      <p>And most of all…fear that you aren’t good enough and weren’t really worthy of that goal in the first place.</p>

      <p>Deep down inside, what sabotages all endeavours is…</p>

      <br>
      <br>


      <h3 class = "center">Fear that we aren’t good enough to deserve it. </h3>

      <br>
      <br>

      <p>We all have this fear.</p>

      <p>It is this little voice in our heads that will make us doubt every step of the way…</p>

      <p>I’ve witnessed close friends and past students who made it 90% of the way… only to self-sabotage themselves and talk themselves out of it because they feel “unworthy” of deserving that success.</p>

      <p>We are not successful because <b>we feel deep down that we do not deserve it.</b></p>

      <p>This may seem simple, but it’s one thing to know theoretically in your head…</p>

      <p>And it’s another to experience this transformation deep down when applied through experience.</p>

      <p>I realised how important mindset and “inner work” was needed to allow myself to succeed.</p>

      <p>I started to figure out what exactly got people the attractive results that they wanted. And then I was going to devise a step-by-step system I could teach myself to become that exceptional student.</p>

      <p>Eventually, after thousands of hours of anguish and heartache…<b>I finally cracked the code.</p></b>

      <p>I understood exactly what universities and scholarships were looking for in an applicant and more importantly, a learner. </p>
      <p>And I was able to teach myself how to show them I had it and… </p>
      <br>
      <h2 class = "center" style="color:blue;">MY LIFE CHANGED OVERNIGHT.</h2>
      <br>
      <p>I reapplied to <b>8 different universities</b> and scholarships…and <u>EVERY SINGLE ONE</u> of my applications were accepted.

      <p>Does this work with other people? Well…my personal statement course students have successfully applied to Oxbridge and many top universities in various disciplines such as Law, Philosophy Politics & Economics (PPE), Medicine, Computer Science, Physics, Maths, International Relations, History, Engineering, English Literature, and Chemistry. </p>
      <br>
      <p>But I decided that this wasn’t enough…I wanted to create a comprehensive, complete guide that will help students excel in their academic and social lives.</p>

      <h2 class = "center">It took me <b>over 3 years</b>, studying and journeying <b>across the world</b>, interviewing some of the world’s best <b>performing students and peak performance experts</b>, and <b>thousands of dollars spent on life, relationships and masculinity coaching</b> out of my own pocket… </h2>
      <br>
      <p>Exploring deeply the fields of psychology, human behavior, peak performance and many other disciplines…</p>
      <p>To discover, test, and systemize the secret steps to attaining, maintaining, and growing your success academically, socially and beyond</p>
      <p>And I put them all into my new course – </p>
      <br>
      <h2 class = "center">“Academic Mastery: how to get <b>consistent results</b> and <b>complete freedom</b> in your <b>academic and social life</b> as a student</h2>
      <br>

      <h5><b>How to become the exceptional STUDENT you were meant to be -- and attain and sustain the results you are meant to be having.</b></h5>
      <br>
      <p>Although this might be the first time you’ve heard of all this… and you may be feeling shocked like this is all new to you…</p>
      <p>I’m guessing that you—like me—have felt as if something has been missing from your student life for a very long time now…</p>
      <p>This hunch can’t be described very well with words…</p>
      <p>We know that, as students, we  <b> SHOULD </b>  feel or act a certain way, and we want to feel that way…</p>
      <p>Perhaps it’s certainty about doing well in school, or being an all-star who is great at school and outside school, or having the fortitude to weather mistakes, or simply regaining the enjoyment of true learning…</p>
      <p>Whatever it is, it’s like that nagging feeling that never quite makes it significant enough to resolve…  </p>
      <p>One of the greatest challenges as a student is feeling anxious, frustrated, and unable to get what you want… but to not know the SOURCE of this… or a way to overcome it RELIABLY and CONSISTENTLY.</p>
      <p>What we have known all along is that these feelings prevent us from achieving peak success in school, in our social relationships, and in life.</p>
      <p>Feeling that there’s a missing purpose and meaning to being a student, and wanting to fill that void is bad enough…</p>
      <p>What makes it unbearable is that the one thing that we want at every level more than anything — self-worth and feeling good enough—is tied DIRECTLY to this particular issue.</p>
      <p><b>So... I'd like to show you how to put all this behind you... and finally become the outstanding student you were meant to be</b></p>
      <br>
      <p>I’ve spent the last 3+ years crafting together a comprehensive course on both <i>academics</i> and <i>social life</i>  — designed to completely equip you with the mind-sets, strategies and skills inside of you that you can use for the <i>rest of your life</i>… and transform you into the passionate, confident, outstanding student that all schools, peers and professors are looking for. </p>

      <p>If we’re making you excel in the coming few months of the course, we have to be clear on <u>one thing</u>.</p>
    <p>Your results are not going to improve dramatically without your <b>full commitment.</b> We are looking for <b>committed and driven</b> individuals who want a bigger future. Fortunately, I’m in the enviable position of not needing to appeal to everyone — just the right people.</p>

      <ol class = "browser-default">

        <li>If you’re difficult to work with, unable to adapt, and generally have a negative attitude or outlook in life, you will not fit in with our community and you will not stay very long.</li>
          <br>
        <li>You’re just looking for some “quick tips” or “motivating words”. I believe the biggest motivation is to get the RESULTS, so while I’m friendly and encouraging, I’m ultimately concerned with your success, not if you like me. </li>

    <p>Every competitor has equally good grades.</h6>
    <p>(i.e. 90% of law applicants have AAA/A qualifications)</h6>
<p>So…where is your <b>differentiating X Factor?</b> </p>
    <br>
    <p>This course turns you into a self-propelled learning machine. </p>
    <ul class = "nocenter">
        <li>It allows you to <b>rework and personalize</b> your applicant and interview responses so it becomes an <b>extension of you…</b></li>
        <li>Using this course, you can learn how to decide <b>what information is important</b> to know, and what can be safely ignored for your application and interviews</li>
        <li><b>How to remember</b> what you need to know…</li>
        <li><b>How to anticipate</b> and even <b>influence</b> what kinds of questions will be in in interviews…</li>
        <li>How to <b>express yourself most effectively</b> in your applications and interviews</li>
        <li>The unconscious triggers interviewers look for in <b>the first 10 seconds</b> when you enter to determine if they will accept you</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In short, this course will teach you how to win the game of school. It’ll show you not just what to do and why, but also what not to do.</p>
    
    <p>I’ll walk you through a process, so that you can see how the various pieces and skills work together to enhance your strengths, not just with grades.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Even if you are a current student…</h3>
    <br>
    <p>This course will introduce you to an entirely new way of looking at school.</p>
    <p>Smart, successful students learn more, in <b>less time</b>, earn higher grades, and have <b>more fun</b> in the process.</p>
    <p>This course shows you how to become one. And anyone can become one. </p>
    <p>But how can this be true? Aren’t they just born gifted that way?</p>
    <p>Until now, your learning has probably been a <b>hit-or-miss</b> – frustratingly inconsistent and inefficient.</p>
    <p>No one bothered to teach you the most fundamental academic skill: <b>How to learn.</b></p>
    <p>Everyone (and perhaps you) probably assumed you were either born with the talent or not.</p>
    <br>
    <h4><b>This belief is completely wrong. And I want to demystify this.</b></h4>
    <br>
<p>Everyone learns naturally from birth as a baby, but <b>learning in school</b> is a different case.</p>
    <p>Schools are structured in a way that doesn’t fit how you learn best.</p>
    <p>What if you’re already a smart student?</p>
    <p><b>It doesn’t matter. Your misconceptions about school and how to learn are probably making school a lot harder than it has to be.</b></p>
    <p>You could be freeing up so much more time and energy, with so much less stress…</p>
    <p>You’ll also discover new ways to socialise, deepen your connections with other people, and maximise your time outside of schoolwork.</p>
    <p>What would it be worth to you to excel in school and have so much freedom and fun while doing it?</p>
    <br>
    <p>On the other hand…</p>
    <p>If you don’t take this course and learn how to enjoy school…</p>
    <p>Well, this is one pile of books I had to read to fully prepare for this course.</p>
    <img src = "assets/img/pile.png" alt = "pile of books">
<br><br>
<br>    <p>I then had to take notes and summarise the information. Round Two.</p>
    <img src = "assets/img/notepile.png">
<br><br>
    <p>Round Three was probably another 1000 pages of notes and further remaking (you don’t remember everything first-pass through).</p>
    <img src = "assets/img/1000page.png">
    <p>Can you imagine doing that and hating every moment of it to study for a single test in school?</p>
    <p>The fonts are small…everything feels so boring to read…meanwhile you’re thinking about what’s for dinner or who you’re going to meet later or…</p>
    <p>Imagine how many torturous hours, sleepless nights and all-nighters you’d have to pull…</p>
    <p>But you can also learn how to enjoy school by yourself through self-help books and other personal development resources…right?</p>
    <p>Here’s what the local bookstore offers you.</p>
    
    
</div><img class="img-thumbnail" src="assets/img/bookstore.png"><div class = "textcentralise">
<p>This is the amount of books in your local bookstore you would have to sift through to find valuable pieces of advice (and good books are rare and few)</p>
    <p>At this point you must be thinking…UGH I want to get results in school and socialise but I don’t want to go through all that junk just to learn the important bits.</p>
    <p>Here’s what the Academic Mastery course offers:</p>
    <ul class = "nocenter">
        <li>Just a <b>3 day seminar series</b> in an immersive live learning experience. Proximity is power.</li>
      <li>Entirely led by Joel Ong and Ivan Leo personally (we went through the arduous pain of the first two options already)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Basically, you have three options here.</h2>
    <br>
    <p>First option, you can give up on your dreams and all the benefits of being an exceptional student and continue doing what you’re doing (with a little bit of pain).</p>
    <p>But let’s be frank, you wouldn’t have read up to this point if you wanted that.</p>
    <p>You’re here because you believe that you deserve a better school and lifestyle than the one you have now.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Second option, is that you can study on your own.</p>
    <p>Again, it’s very tough and time-consuming without the shortcuts we know…</p>
    <p>and this is an option for people who are strong in synthesising large volumes of information from various diverse sources into practical usable things to apply.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Or third option, is that you enroll in our course.</p>
    <p>It gives you step by step guidance on exactly how to achieve <b>consistent results</b> and <b>complete freedom</b> in your academic and social life as a student.</p>
    <p>Forget the self-help textbooks, this is what you need. One seminar series. One 3-day course. That’s it.</p>
    <p>Also, the recordings will be edited, remastered, and made available on our private site…</p>
    <p>So you can go back and review it as much as you want…</p>
    <p>and you can have it to watch any time you need it… forever.</p>
    <p>I’ve decided to set the investment for this course not at $10,000… or even $5,500… or even $3,500.</p>

    <h3>Instead, your investment for Academic Mastery is only 1077 SGD for the whole thing</h3>
    <br>
    <h4><i>Nearly 40 hours worth of cutting-edge content. That’s only 27 SGD per hour.</i></h4>
    <br>
    <h5><b>And if you miss any live section of the course…re-watch it in the comfort of your home or classroom at a time that works for you..</b></h5>
    <br>
    <h6>There’s also a monthly payment plan, if it makes it even easier for you to afford it.</h6>

                <h1>Your investment for the Academic Mastery course is much less than <strong>a third of a month’s</strong> starting&nbsp;salary. &nbsp;<br></h1>
                <p style="padding:20px 0 10px 0;"><strong>Years from now, when you’re looking back, how are you going to feel if you could have been experiencing incredibly amazing student life and grades, and finding it easy to befriend the peers who would make you truly happy for the rest of your life, just by taking a simple, walk-you-through-it course?</strong><br><br><strong>Looking back, how much more opportunities and salary are you going to command if you</strong><br><strong>could attain better results in school? </strong><br><br>Remember,
                    all successful people invest in themselves and plan for tomorrow. What about<br>you?<br></p>
                <h1 class="text-center" style="font-size:60px;">FAQ Questions</h1>
                <p><strong><em>Is this only&nbsp;for people who are already in university or doing well or also for people who&nbsp;are currently looking to enter one and doing poorly? What about people who are&nbsp;good with socialising?</em></strong><br><br>If
                    you’re in a university already, you definitely need to take Academic Mastery because you may be just weeks from some serious trouble with schoolwork or people, unless you're already deep in it.<br><br>And yes, even if you’re still
                    a prospective student, you need to be working on this for several reasons. First, you can only keep up an “act” in an application for so long. You can totally get to theinterview stage with the typical application... but once you find
                    yourself inthe interview, you’ll quickly find that the ‘facade is up’ and that interviewers are noticing the cracks in your exterior and can no longer trust you to be as confident or able as you say you are. They might test you with
                    tough questions, or just put you on edge in a “moment of silence” where you hold court with them, but your non-verbals give away your uncertainty or anxiety, no matter how bad you try to hide it.<br><br>Also, there’s the fact that
                    you’re never really “done” with improving yourself... including once you have great results in school. There’s something called the “once and done” myth, where people believe, “Oh, once I have that A and got a stamp of approval from
                    my professors, or once I got an awesome circle of friends, I’m GOLD. I can just work on my hobbies and the school and social game is just automatically taken care of.” As much as every movie in Hollywood strokes this “happily ever
                    after” myth, the real truth is that it takes actually some careful effort to have an amazing time... one where both your schoolwork and social life can complement AND support you in a way that never gets old. This is something you
                    have to start BEFORE you need it... because once you’re in a pinnacle of success, you’re already in damage control and becoming complacent if you don’t know this.<br><br><strong><em>Can I tell friends&nbsp;that I'm taking this?</em></strong><br><br>Yes,
                    absolutely. In fact, after their initial surprise, they will probably thank you for it. After all, you're doing it not just for you, but for your peers too (peer group effect). And, you might just inspire them to invest in themselves,
                    as well!<br><br><strong><em>Is this&nbsp;suitable for both men and woman to learn from?</em></strong><br><br>Yes, absolutely! All of the material in the Learning and Social modules are applicable to both men and women. Women will also
                    probably be interested in learning about what we're covering in the Bio-energy modules.<br><br><strong><em>What is&nbsp;the age range of the students?</em></strong><br><br>Our membership ranges in age from 18 to the 30s. Age has never
                    stopped any of our members from learning to enjoy the learning and socialising process.<br><br>&nbsp;<strong><em>Do I get&nbsp;access to the entire course at once?"</em></strong><br><br>No, and that is intentional. Academic Mastery&nbsp;is
                    not about me dumping tons of information on you, wiping my hands, and saying, “See ya!” I intentionally tested and structured the material with precisely the right pace so you get the best results. I release new material to you every
                    week throughout the program.<br><br><strong><em>How much&nbsp;time does it take to attend this course per seminar day?</em></strong><br><br>Based on our current schedule, I'd say 10 hours per seminar day. But to facilitate everybody,
                    it will be conducted on a weekend. Also, everybody is a little different. Obviously, the more time you can put in, the faster you’ll see results. If you are unable to attend any parts of the seminar, all the course materials are accessible
                    online from the convenience of your computer (or smartphone or tablet). And every module comes with detailed accompanying slides so that you can see what the class is all about at a<br>glance. Because Academic Mastery&nbsp;comes with
                    Lifetime Access, you have the luxury of going at whatever pace you desire.<br><br><br></p>
                <h1 class="text-center" style="font-size:60px;">What If...</h1>
                <p><strong><em>What if I just fall&nbsp;behind?"</em></strong><br><br>Don't worry: Academic Mastery -- including the seminar and all 5+1 weeks of online video modules beautifully presented in your membership site accessible from anywhere
                    at any time, the 24/7 online support community, the direct access to Joel and Ivan personally, and all the PDF course materials --<br>comes with Lifetime Access. So you can take a break from the material if you’re out of town, travelling,
                    or just swamped for a few days. Interruptions happen, and Academic Mastery will ALWAYS be here for you when you're ready.<br><br><strong>What if I live in the UK or United States(US) or somewhere else?</strong><br><br>Yes, Academic
                    Mastery will help you. I've derived what I teach in this course from people&nbsp;from almost every continent in the world for over 3 years.<br><br><strong><em>What if I'm Caucasian/&nbsp;African-American/ Hispanic/ left-handed/ a morning person/ a night person/ from&nbsp;Woodlands in Singapore? How will this help me?"</em></strong><br><br>I
                    call this “Special Snowflake Syndrome,” where we believe something in our lives is so unique, nothing will ever help. At some point, you’re looking for an excuse not to join. My goal is to show you that is not<br>true, that it's just
                    a crippling excuse. I've tested this material with beginners, experienced students, Asians, Americans, British, Canadians, Chinese, Indians, and yes, this includes both morning and night people. If you truly believe you are so unique
                    that 3+ years of the most comprehensive material on succeeding in your academic and social life will not help you, then please don’t join!<br><br><strong><em>Can I&nbsp;just buy a portion of the program?</em></strong><br><br>No. This
                    is an entire system, not a series of disconnected tactics.<br><br><strong><em>What if&nbsp;I cannot attend the live seminar?"</em></strong><br><br>If you cannot attend the live seminar, or any part of it, the recordings will be edited,
                    remastered, and made available on our private membership site so you can go back and review it as much as you want and watch any time you need it. You can also clarify any questions through the online community.<br><br><strong><em>Do you&nbsp;offer any instalment plans?</em></strong><br><br>Yes!
                    Take a look at the pricing tables for more details.<br><br><strong><em>Are&nbsp;there any hidden fees or costs?"</em></strong><br><br>No, there are no hidden fees or costs. Everything that is included in the program tuition is clearly
                    outlined in the page description before you register. This includes the rental cost for the venue.<br><br><strong><em>Do I get&nbsp;my money back?</em></strong><br><br>No, this seminar series is non-refundable given the live nature
                    of the event.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><em>When&nbsp;will this be available again?"</em></strong><br><br>We may have plans to reopen this program, but THE PRICE MIGHT INCREASE. The current offer is that we’ll keep it&nbsp;<strong>at this price.&nbsp;</strong>So
                    get it early, even if you cannot attend the live event ;)<br></p>

                <p><strong><em>How is this different from other courses on the market? What are your credentials?"</em></strong><br><br>Academic Mastery is the only academic and social course that applies the best cutting edge scientific research of psychology
                    and other practical fields to the reality of modern student conditions, including the current tuition crisis afflicting so many students around the world – that there is something wrong with the student. No other program begins with
                    the premise that something is wrong with school, includes an entire system on how to mould school to their needs instead of accepting school as it is, and contains coursework successfully tested for over 3 years with hundreds of students.<br><br>All
                    this beautifully packaged into a proven, step-by-step system so that you can finally attain complete confidence, freedom and joy in your academic and social student life. This step-by-step system is based entirely on&nbsp;<em>rigorous&nbsp;scientific research</em>.&nbsp;My
                    own training and development is largely conducted by<br>academics, so it's in my nature to teach&nbsp;<em>only </em>what's been backed up by empirically verified results. <br><br><strong><em>Are the lessons applicable to other countries or only for Singapore or Asian countries?"</em></strong><br><br>Academic
                    Mastery’s methodologies are based on science. This includes cutting edge research from neuroscience, psychology, and other behavioural and natural sciences conducted in universities around the world which form the core of our curriculum.
                    These work in any country with human beings!.<br><br>Part of my other job is an international creative producer, and I have the privilege to work with global travel organisations and artists, and have travelled to 70+ destinations.
                    And I bring all my international experience to bear in my coaching. Our community will include people from all over the world.<br><br><strong><em>Will&nbsp;there be a lot of time devoted to my personal, individual questions and&nbsp;problems?</em></strong><br><br>Yes,
                    a major bonus component of Academic Mastery is direct access to personal guidance from Joel and Ivan personally inside the online support community, available to you 24/7 for life. So yes, we will be on hand to do our best to handle&nbsp;your
                    personal, individual questions and problems during the program.<br><br><strong><em>Your&nbsp;program does sound a bit too good to be true. How can this be for real? What&nbsp;happens if I don’t top succeed? If it is true, you will see me sign up by the&nbsp;end of the day!</em></strong><br><br>It's
                    good for me to meet this kind of scepticism because in my life and work, I am constantly surrounded by people who transform themselves and see massive success on a daily basis, not just with school, but from life.<br><br>Look, instead
                    of telling you about the rare cases when someone didn't soar as high as we had hoped, let me tell you about the many that did: They are hungry. They consume the material again and again. They<br>follow the program and they train repeatedly.
                    And they are in the REAL WORLD and apply and practice what they've learned.<br><br>So if the confident "feelings" disappear, or they didn’t get what they hoped, they review the lessons or re-watch the videos. They keep in touch with
                    their fellow members through our private support groups. They really dedicate energy and time and a lot of themselves into this area of their lives and that's why they receive a lot from it. They've given us their trust, and they've
                    experienced enough results to continue to give us more. They become success stories over time. <br><br>There are a few pseudo-whack books claiming to teach students how to earn high grades without learning much, but these books are
                    missing the point. <br><br>This course teaches you to learn as much as you can and earn high grades, but just not <strong>sacrificing any&nbsp;unnecessary time</strong>&nbsp;and being sleep deprived doing so. <br><br>I would love to
                    have you on board. At this point, the choice is entirely yours and I trust you will make that leap of faith with me. If not, thanks for reading this far, and I wish you the best.<br></p>
                <h1 class="text-center" style="font-size:60px;"><br>The biggest and best<br>thing you can do is investing in yourself.<br></h1>
                <p><br><br>During the 3+ years I spent researching the material for Academic Mastery, I tried all of the best courses and self-help books in this area only to find that they regurgitated more of the same old, rehashed, generic info, obvious,
                    trite or impractical recommendations.<br><br>I tried very hard to follow some of their suggestions, but I lacked the super-discipline their suggestions necessarily required. And many only resulted in very superficial understandings
                    and no real consistency.<br><br>I realised that any student who could do these impossibly hard things wouldn’t need help with school in the first place. <br><br>But they were very miserable in doing so and didn’t enjoy it. Or they
                    spent so much time and headspace with schoolwork that they neglected their social life and was lonely or bored to tears. Some had very<br>little energy and no physical or mental health.<br><br>That's not good enough for me, for Academic
                    University, or for my clients.<br><br>Almost every student I spoke to told me I had to sacrifice and give up either one or the other, choosing to compromise between grades, a social life, health, sleep, and time. They even had this
                    “Choose 2 of 3<br>triangle” Meme on the web that blew up awhile back.<br><br>But I wanted to be able to enjoy learning while doing well in school, and be able to have an awesome social life at the same time.<br><br>That's why I invested
                    thousands of hours and thousands of dollars of my own money into developing this course, flying around the globe to consult the world’s top researchers and students, personal development and peak performance coaches, creating brand-new
                    curriculums, testing them, hiring<br>top-tier staff, and putting together the best lessons ever.<br><br>I know this material works. I only care about developing the highest quality lessons, full of proven methods, mindsets, strategies,
                    systems, psychological experiences, and more that you can't find anywhere else.<br><br>And I'd like to share it with you if you're ready to use it to experience complete confidence, freedom and joy in your academic and social life.<br><br>Now
                    is the time to step up and act. Because there is a live support component to this program, we have to close registration for this course once the timer hits<strong>&nbsp;00:00:00.</strong><br></p>
